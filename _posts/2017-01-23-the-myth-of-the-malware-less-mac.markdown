title: The Myth of the Malware-less Mac
---

One argument for the use of Macintosh computers I have often heard is that they aren't as likely to get viruses or other malware as Windows computers. In fact, this is a line that I once parroted in my younger, more naive days. I've even heard people make the argument that Macs *can't* get viruses. 

This, sadly, is simply not true, as we can see in one of this week's more popular news items. 

Researchers have discovered a new backdoor program for Mac OS X that allows attackers to take screen shots, access Web cams, and search for other devices on the local network. Though, when I say "new," I mean "new to public knowledge." There is evidence that this malware has been around for at least four years, but possibly for decades. 

If you have a Mac computer, don't worry too much about this particular backdoor, though. Apple is already aware of it -- they've even named it "Fruitfly" -- and are pushing an update to Mac computers that will protect against it. Also, it appears to primarily target biomedical research facilities, so unless you're an experimental biologist, you probably aren't on the perpetrator's hit list. That said, stories like this are of interest because they punch a hole through the misconception that simply using a Mac keeps you safe from criminal hackers.

It's true that historically malware has targeted Macs much less than Windows PCs due to it's low market share, but as Apple's devices have become more popular, so have they become a more interesting target for criminals. Add to this that Macs frequently find themselves in academic and scientific settings, and you have a very interesting target for those with a mind for espionage or to profit from stolen information. You may not be the original target for the malware, but these programs have a tendency to get away from their creators and see use by other criminals.

The trend here is pretty hard to dispute. Both 2015 and 2016 were described as record breaking years for Mac malware infections, as security researchers identified an ever-growing list of malicious programs targeting Apple's computers. The risk for Macs is still somewhat lower than for Windows machines, but that doesn't mean Mac owners should disregard security entirely. 

So, what you do to keep your Mac safe?

The answer to good security is always going to be multi-layered. You simply can't rely on any one solution to work 100 percent of the time, so you need to have several barriers between your computer and would-be attackers.

In my opinion, the three most important things you can do are:
1. Practice safe Web browsing and email usage.
2. Install (and keep up-to-date) a reputable anti-virus program.
3. Always install patches for your operating system and applications as quickly as possible. 

Just doing those three things will keep your Mac (or any computer, really) safe from most attacks. Criminals are going to prefer the easiest targets, so the more hurdles you can put in your way, the less interested they will be in trying to break into your computer.

Check back here over the next couple of weeks, as I will be discussing in detail how to follow the security best practices I listed above. It's really not that hard to do, it just requires a little mindfulness and vigilance on your part.
