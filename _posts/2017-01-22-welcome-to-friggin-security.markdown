###Welcome

This is my first post, and really just a test to make sure I have this thing set up correctly. But, since I'm here, I'd like to say a few things about what I intend for this blog.

One of the biggest threats to the security of our digital world is the recruitment of masses of consumer devices for the execution of nefarious activities. In other words, hackers are hijacking people's computers and using them to attack other people. There is some movement among electronics manufacturers to build more secure devices, but that has been slow to gain traction, and probably won't until those manufacturers see some profit motive to act responsibly. That leaves many consumers open to threats that could both compromise their finances and data, and make their computers complicit in a wide range of criminal activities. 

I believe a major piece of this puzzle involves getting people to take network security as seriously as they take their home's physical security. Locking doors and installing alarm systems on homes is a no-brainer for most people, and that same attitude should extent to the networks in their homes.

Achieving this will require two things:

1. Education, in terms understandable to the lay person, on the importance of security and what they can do to live securely in a digital age
2. Easy-to-use, inexpensive (or free!) security tools -- both software and hardware -- that are as simple to implement as installing locks on your home doors (conceptually, at least)

My intent for this blog is to address the first issue by writing a series of articles highlighting the threats that face our networks, and what we can do to protect ourselves, all in language that a non-technical user can understand. In other words, I'll be writing these articles so that my mother can understand them and follow their guidance.

I'm looking forward to writing for this blog, and hope that you, dear reader, will find it educational and entertaining. But, most of all, I hope I can help us all become more responsible, secure digital citizens.
